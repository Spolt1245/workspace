   <p> <b> <font color="aqua">The monitor is like a TV, but it connects to the computer. It is a separate part which allows to see what the computer is displaying. It makes it so that you can even see what your doing on the computer. The monitor lets you use the computer.  </font> </b> </p>
   
<h2>History</h2>
<font color="black"><ul>    
<li> <b> Monitors used to be very bulky, and took up a lot of space on a desk. But now as the technology has become better, monitors are very small, and slim. The monitors are hd, compared to monitors before. </b> </li>
