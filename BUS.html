<p> <font color="white"> <br> <b> The BUS of the computer is the wires that connects everything together, mainly connects things to the motherboard. The BUS transfers the information from many parts to the head of the computer. The BUS tells the computer what is happening so that it can function. These wires keep the computer together, because without it, it would not work. The wires vary from size, they power so many different parts of the computer. Each wire is made specially for carrying out certain functions.</font>
