        <p> A motherboard is a board with circuits, that connects the <br> basic part of a computer so that it can function. It is where the <br> CPU, BUS, Disk drive, and the RAM connect. It is the <br> main part of the computer so it can work. The motherboard
            is a <br> medium size board that is usually green, but it depends. It has <br> small, and big intricate designs that connects all the parts of the <br> computer together. </p>

        <li> Over many decades the motherboard has changed in size. <br> During the time of its creation is was very big, and circuit printing <br> wasn't very cheap. Now the motherboards have dropped in size, they are better made. </li>

            <p> The CPU stands for central processing unit, which is the most <br> important part of the computer. It is the head of the computer. <br> This part of the computer makes all of the calculations required <br> for the computer. The CPU has small
                little chips that are built into it, <br> this allows the CPU to function. The CPU is not big in size, it is a <br> square chip that connects to the motherboard. There are tiny <br> connections that power it. </p>

    <h2> Current version </h2>

    <ul>
        <li> There are many times of CPU processors, but one that is the latest <br> is Intel Xeon E5-2670, which is top of the line, because it is a <br> very fast CPU. This CPU is cheap, but extremely effective to complete task fast.</li>
