    <font color="white"><h2> History </h2></font>
    <ul><p> <b> <font color="lime">Before keyboards came out, people used what is know as a typewriter. The typewriter had keys like the keyboards have today. The keys pressed are printed on a piece of paper, just like a printer. The typewriter was made of many gears, and it was very bulky. These days keyboards consist of electronics. The keyboards are cheap to make, and they are very slim. The keyboard puts the letters on the computer. There are so many types of keyboards. </b> </font>
