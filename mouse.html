 <font color="white"> <h2> History </h2></font>
 <ul>  
  <b> <font color="white"><li>When computers first came out the computer didn't have a mouse to control it. You would type in commands that tells the computer what to do. The mouse used to consist of just a few pieces of metal, and a few electronics. The mouse used a ball to make it move on the screen of the computer. These days the computer mouse uses an LED light to sense where the mouse is, which tells the computer where the mouse is moving on the screen. The technology used is very good. </li> </font> </b>
